RFID Student Attendance System
Welcome to the RFID Student Attendance System project! This repository contains the code and resources for implementing a streamlined and efficient attendance tracking system using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology.

Overview
Tracking student attendance can be a time-consuming and error-prone task, especially in large classes or institutions. This project leverages RFID technology to automate the attendance process, making it faster, more accurate, and less labor-intensive. Each student is provided with an RFID card, which they can simply tap on an RFID reader to mark their attendance.

Key Features
Automated Attendance: Eliminates manual roll call and reduces errors.
Real-Time Monitoring: Instantly updates attendance records in real-time.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface for both students and administrators.
Secure Data Handling: Ensures the integrity and confidentiality of attendance data.
Scalability: Suitable for classrooms, labs, and large institutions.
Technologies Used
Hardware: RFID readers and RFID cards.
Software: Python (or relevant language used), Database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite), Web framework (if applicable).
Libraries and Frameworks: List any specific libraries or frameworks used in the project.
Getting Started
To get started with the RFID Student Attendance System, please refer to the detailed setup and installation instructions in the Installation Guide section.

Contributions
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you for your interest in the RFID Student Attendance System. We hope this project helps in creating a more efficient and reliable attendance tracking process for educational institutions.
